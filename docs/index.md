# ðŸŽ¨ Art Perception Analysis

## ðŸ§ª Project Overview

This project explores how three visual factorsâ€”**brightness**, **size**, and **colourfulness**â€”influence the number of people attracted to different paintings. Using a synthetic dataset collected from controlled observations, we examine patterns and anomalies in visual preferences using various plots and statistical visualizations.

## ðŸ§  Key Findings

ðŸ“ˆ When analysed individually, all three factorsâ€”brightness, size, and colourfulnessâ€”show an **increasing pattern** in the number of people attracted as the **intensity increases**.

![Colourfulness BarPlot](./images/colourfulness_plot.png)

ðŸ”¥ According to the heatmaps, the **most attention** was drawn to:

  - **Moderately bright + large** sized paintings.

  - **Low colourfulness + large** sized paintings.  

  This is a bit unexpected, isnâ€™t it?

The reason behind this can be seen using box plots for brightness and colourfulness as it shows outliers:

![Colourfulness + Size Boxplot](./images/colourfulness+size_boxplot.png)

As seen, there are outliers in both the boxplots resulting in the strange results from the heatmaps!!

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusions

- **Size matters most**â€”larger paintings consistently attracted more viewers.
- **Brightness has a sweet spot**â€”extremely bright or dim artworks were less appealing.
- **Colourfulness** isnâ€™t always linearâ€”sometimes low-colour paintings performed better, possibly due to minimalism or contrast.
